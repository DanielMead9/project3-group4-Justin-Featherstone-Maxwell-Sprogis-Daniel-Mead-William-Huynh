        <p>
          Rotating and balancing your tires is the most efficient method of
          increasing the life of your tires. Just like shoes, tires become worn
          in certain areas because they experience friction. A set of tires is
          one of the most expensive things to replace on your vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rotate and balance is a phrase that describes two specific procedures
          that increase the safety and efficiency of your tires. Tires are
          rotated according to manufacturers specifications. When they are
          balanced, the technician uses a special machine to check to see if the
          weight of the tire and wheel is balanced. If it is not, the technician
          will attach small lead weights to the rim of the wheel to ensure that
          they are balanced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most manufacturers recommend that all four tires should be rotated and
          balanced at least every seven thousand miles. A great way to keep up
          with this recommendation is to have your tires rotated and balanced
          about every time you have your oil changed.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the most important reasons to rotate your tires is safety.
          Typically, tread wears away quicker on the front tires than on the
          back. The less tread you have on the front tires, the easier it is to
          loose control of your vehicle. Rotating the tires according to
          manufacturers specifications keeps more tread on the tires for a
          longer period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second reason this maintenance practice is so important is that it
          is efficient. If you do not rotate and balance your tires, you will
          have to replace your front tires much more often than your rear tires.
          Regularly rotating them allows all four tires to become worn at the
          same rate. This allows you to purchase a complete set of four tires
          instead of two pairs at separate times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rotating and balancing your tires is a great way to ensure that your
          car won't slip or skid because of worn treads. It is also an excellent
          way to increase the time until you have to purchase a new set.
