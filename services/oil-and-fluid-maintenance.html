        <p>
          Today's cars are the best they've ever been, but they're still not
          maintenance-free wonder machines. Cars also need frequent TLC, and its
          an auto's six different fluids that need the most attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fluids play a huge role in almost every facet of your car, including
          fuel economy and longevity. Keeping them at the proper level will help
          your car last longer and drive better, something we can all get
          behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oil is your car's most important fluid. Engines components spin
          thousands of times a minute, and it's oil that keeps everything moving
          smoothly. Oil level is one thing, but its condition is equally
          important. Oil level and quality should be checked regularly and
          changed as and when needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all the combustion and friction that happens in an engine, it
          produces a lot of heat. Coolant works to keep everything cool, by
          absorbing engine heat and dissipating it through the radiator.
          Maintaining the correct coolant level prevents overheating. Coolant
          levels need be checked less frequently than oil but at least every
          50,000 miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Power steering systems are hydraulic, using pressurized fluid to make
          turning the wheel effortless (though some newer models now rely on
          electric steering). There's no set time-frame on when power steering
          fluid needs to be replaced, but you should have it checked regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time brake fluid can become contaminated by water, which can make
          brake lines rust. Leaks can also form, leading to a spongy pedal feel
          or irregular brake performance. Brake fluid level and quality should
          be regularly checked and flushed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transmission fluid serves a similar purpose as oil in the engine: it
          lubricates and cools the components inside your transmission.
          Transmissions contain gears, clutches (even in automatics), and valves
          which must move smoothly to provide seamless shifts. While some
          transmissions come with "lifetime" fluid that should never need
          replacement, bad transmission fluid can cause rough shifting, strange
          noises and uncontrolled surging that make driving difficult. If you
          experience any transmission issues, have a professional mechanic
          inspect the fluid condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Windshield washer fluid doesn't have any effect on your car's
          performance, but it's still vital to safe driving. After all, if you
          can't see where you're going, you won't get very far. Have it checked
          whenever your car is in for service of any kind.
