        <p>
          Our staff consists of trained technicians and mechanics who are
          committed to providing you with the best automotive service. Our
          technicians are trained to work with the computers and the compatible
          equipment to discover the problems in your car.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team works on traditional mechanical components, such as engines,
          transmissions, and drive belts. However, they are also familiar with a
          growing number of electronic systems. Braking, transmission, and
          steering systems, for example, are controlled primarily by computers
          and electronic components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other systems, such as accident-avoidance sensors, are becoming common
          as well. In addition, a growing number of technicians are required to
          work on vehicles that run on alternative fuels, such as ethanol and
          electricity.
        </p>

        <h3>Our technicians perform:</h3>

        <h4>Scheduled Factory Maintenance</h4>
        <p>
          Every vehicle manufacturer recommends periodically servicing your
          vehicle for good reason. Proper vehicle maintenance will increase the
          longevity of your vehicle and avoid costly and potentially dangerous
          breakdowns.
        </p>
        <p>
          At AV Repair, we have invested in the people, training, and equipment
          to fix just about any vehicle on the road today. There is no need to
          go back to the car dealer for these routine services. We can perform
          the exact same services for less money and in less time. You DO NOT
          have to go back to the car dealer for service to maintain the vehicle
          warranty. It is your vehicle, and you have the right to repair it
          wherever you like.
        </p>

        <h4>Automotive air-conditioning service</h4>
        <p>
          Install and repair air conditioners and parts, such as compressors,
          condensers, and controls. Our technicians are trained in government
          regulations related to their work.
        </p>

        <h4>Brake repairs</h4>
        <p>
          Adjust brakes, replace brake rotors and pads, and make other repairs
          on brake systems.
        </p>

        <h4>Front-end service</h4>
        <p>
          Align and balance wheels and repair steering mechanisms and suspension
          systems.
        </p>

        <h4>Driveability</h4>
        <p>
          Our technicians use their extensive knowledge of engine management,
          emission, fuel, electrical, and ignition systems to diagnose issues
          that prevent engines from performing efficiently.
