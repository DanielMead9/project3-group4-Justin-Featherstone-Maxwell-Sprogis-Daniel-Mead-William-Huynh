        <p>
          For the peak performance of your vehicle, your engine must be healthy.
          AV Repair's tuning services can help keep your engine healthy and
          operating at peak performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          At AV Repair we frequently meet vehicle owners who have questions.
          What is an engine tune-up? How often should my car get one?
        </p>
        <p>
          To perform a basic engine tune-up procedure, AV Repair goes through a
          series of inspections:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Visually inspect the engine's fuel-system components looking to make
            sure the fuel filter is clean and clog-free, that a clogged filter
            hasn't caused any damage to the fuel pump, and that the fuel
            injectors are free of deposits and other grime.
          </li>
          <li>Visually inspect the spark plugs to gauge their age and wear.</li>
          <li>Check spark plug for wear and re-gap as necessary.</li>
          <li>
            As needed, replace your vehicle's points and condenser, if
            applicable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check and adjust the ignition timing, timing belts and idle if
            needed.
          </li>
          <li>Check the engine's PCV valve.</li>
          <li>Check the vehicle's engine air filter and cabin air filter.</li>
          <li>Check oil and coolant levels.</li>
          <li>Assess and address cause of “Check Engine” indicator.</li>
          <li>Check and adjust tire inflation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Engine tuning is the adjustment or modification of the engine or ECU
          (engine control unit) to yield optimal performance and increase the
          engine's power output, economy, or durability. These goals may be
          mutually exclusive; an engine may be de-tuned with respect to output
          power in exchange for better economy or longer engine life due to
          lessened stress on engine components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tuning can include a wide variety of adjustments and modifications,
          such as the routine adjustment of the carburetor and ignition system
          to significant engine overhauls. Performance tuning of an engine can
          involve revising some of the design decisions taken during the
          development of the engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting the idle speed, air-fuel-ratio, carburetor balance, spark plug
          and distributor point gaps, and ignition timing are regular
          maintenance tasks for older engines. On modern engines equipped with
          electronic ignition and fuel injection, some or all of these tasks are
          automated but they still require periodic calibration.
        </p>
        <p>
          How often is an engine tune-up needed? Requirements vary from vehicle
          to vehicle, and can also vary based on vehicle mileage and age.
