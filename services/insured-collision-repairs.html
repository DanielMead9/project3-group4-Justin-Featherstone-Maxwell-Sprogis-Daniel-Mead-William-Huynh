        <h3>A Legal Refresher</h3>
        <p>
          Here's a legal refresher when it comes to your rights as a customer
          working with an insurance company:
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          “No staff or independent, appraiser, insurer, representative of
          insurer, or employer of an independent appraiser shall refer the
          claimant to or away from any specific repair shop or require that
          repairs be made by a specific repair shop or individual.” -
          <strong>Commonwealth of MA Regulation 212 2.0.4</strong>
        </div>

        <p>
          Simply put, the choice is entirely yours. And even more importantly,
          the insurance company has no legal right to insist that you should go
          to one body shop over another. It is against MA regulations for anyone
          representing an insurance company to steer you to one of their
          insurance shops or away from the shop of your choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          They also cannot tell you that they won't pay for the repairs
          completed in a licensed shop of your choosing, or that the repair
          costs will be higher. Some of the things you'll hear from insurance
          representatives will be intentionally misleading. Their motivation for
          doing this is to increase their profit margins, often at the expense
          of the quality and safety of your repair.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though these actions are illegal, we see it all the time.
          However, as a collision repair shop with a reputation to uphold, we
          will never cut corners to complete the repair for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          We're dedicated to educating our customers about their rights. We've
          been in the accident repair business for more than 25 years, so we
          have the experience that consumers need to help navigate them through
          conflicting and confusing information provided by insurers. We work
          for you, not your insurance company. And above all, we are here to be
          your advocate for a safe, worry-free repair and a hassle-free claim
          process.
        </p>

        <p>
          We care about you, our customers, and your safety. We've developed
          long-standing, repeat relationships with the people in our community
          over the last three decades. We want to help you get the information
          you need to protect yourself from unsafe, low-quality repairs. One of
          the ways we do this is by providing you with these consumer resources
          so that you'll understand your rights and avoid the steering that's
          all too common in the industry today.
        </p>

        <p>
          We take the hassle out of dealing with insurance claims by working
          directly with your insurance company.
        </p>

        <h3>Remember: <em>Your Car, Your Choice.</em></h3>

        <p>
          Here's a brief summary of your rights when you're in search for the
          right shop for you, and when dealing with your insurers:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You have the right to have your vehicle towed to any location that
            you choose.
          </li>
          <li>
            You do not have to go to a drive-in claims center. Your insurer must
            inspect the vehicle at any location you choose.
          </li>
          <li>You do not have to get multiple appraisals.</li>
          <li>
            Your insurance company is responsible for payment to restore your
            vehicle to pre-accident condition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your insurer must negotiate in good faith with the shop of your
            choice.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, you must notify your insurance company before repairs
            begin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You have the right to choose AV Repair!</strong> AV Repair
