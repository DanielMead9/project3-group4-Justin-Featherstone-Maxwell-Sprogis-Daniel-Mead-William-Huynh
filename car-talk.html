              <strong>Summer will be here soon.</strong> Sports car, classic car
              and hobby car owners, start your engines!
            </p>
            <p>
              Actually, before you do, you’ll want to follow some simple steps
              to bring your summer ride out to play after a long winter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here’s a checklist of what to do — either on your own or at the
              shop — if you’ve had your vehicle stored.
            </p>

            <h3>Top 5 checklist for bringing your car out of winter storage</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Inspect Battery</strong><br />
                The most important item to check is the condition of the car’s
                battery. I hope that you had the battery on a maintainer/tender
                during the storage period? Look at your maintainer to see that
                the battery is fully charged. If not, put it on a charger,
                although the integrity and life of the battery will likely be
                compromised if the charge has completely depleted. Bottom line,
                do not attempt to start a stored vehicle with a half drained
                battery. And don’t boost it. There’s nothing worse that trying
                to crank a cold engine for the first time in months with a weak
                battery.<br />
                When connecting the battery, check the cables and terminals for
                corrosion/oxidization and clean if necessary. Some modern cars
                require the battery to remain connected at all times to maintain
                the on-board computer memory. In this case, a battery maintainer
                still needs to be used during storage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Test Engine oil</strong><br />
                Pull the dipstick to see if there is adequate oil in the engine
                and add if needed. This oil is now old and should be changed at
                your earliest opportunity, even if you changed it just before
                storage. Don’t skip this step. Fresh oil is cheap insurance for
                the health of your engine.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Examine Other fluids</strong><br />
                Check the fluid levels for coolant, power steering, brakes and
                fuel. Did you put fuel stabilizer in the tank before storage? If
                not, add octane booster and get high-octane gas in the tank. Old
                gas will make the engine run rough so adding fuel stabilizer is
                an important precaution prior to storage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Perform a Visual check</strong><br />
                Look in the engine bay and under the car for signs of fluid
                leaks. Observe the electrical wires and hoses, looking for
                cracks and deterioration. Take a screw driver/wrench to the
                various clamps that make up the fuel system to ensure that they
                are tight. Look for signs of unwanted visitors like mice who are
                notorious for chewing electrical wires. Basically, you want to
                do a thorough visual check on the key mechanical components
                before you start the car for the first time and embark on that
                initial drive of the season.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Check Tires</strong><br />
                Check tire pressure and correct as necessary to bring to the
                suggested PSI rating indicated on the sidewall. Look for cracks
                and bulges in the rubber.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Other items</h3>
            <p>
              Look at the brakes to ensure there is adequate pad and rotor
              material. Look at the suspension components and pull on the
              control arms and tie-rods to check for excessive play. Check the
              exhaust and remember to take the steel wool out of the tail pipe
              or whatever you use to prevent rodents from entering.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that you’ve done your due-diligence to ensure that your stored
              vehicle is good to go, put the key in the ignition and fire it up.
              Expect the engine to run rough at first as it will take several
              minutes for the fuel to fully circulate to enable a smooth idle.
              Let the engine idle up to operating temperature before you hit the
              road. Take it easy in the beginning. Remember, this car hasn’t
              been driven for months so don’t push it hard on the first run.
            </p>
            <p>
              The above check list may seem excessive but it is important to
              ensure that your hobby car is ready for the season ahead. You
              don’t want to be disappointed with mechanical problems resulting
              from overlooking an important detail in preparing to bring a
              vehicle out of prolonged storage. Spring is just a few weeks away
              and with lots of heavy rain to wash the salt and crud off the
              roads, classic cars will be back on the scene. Just watch out for
              all the potholes – you’re hobby car will be less forgiving than
              the daily driver.
            </p>

            <h3>And a few final things:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Have brake pads and shocks examined.</li>
              <li>
                Verify that headlights, brights, taillights and blinkers are
                operating.
              </li>
              <li>
                Clear the exhaust pipe, if you plugged it to keep out mice.
              </li>
              <li>
                Inspect the windshield wipers to see if the rubber is cracked or
                brittle.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wash the vehicle to remove any dust or dirt that accumulated.
              </li>
              <li>Air out the interior.</li>
            </ul>

              Accidents are something no one really prepares for although
              everyone should as statistics show that during the course of the
              average driver’s lifetime they will be involved in 3 to 4 of them.
              So a little preventive medicine could go a long way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any accident, even a minor fender bender, can rattle the most
              even-keeled of us. Let’s talk about what to keep in mind and what
              to do at the accident scene. You may even want to print this list
              out and keep it in your glove compartment:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Check to see if there are any physical injuries. If there are,
                don’t think twice, call 911 and call the local police.
              </li>
              <li>
                Even though you may not feel hurt, don’t take chances, get
                checked out at a local hospital. It’s for your own protection as
                sometimes the symptoms of injury aren’t obvious to anyone except
                a doctor.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure to get all the information from the other party
                including driver’s license, license plate number, vehicle
                registration, vehicle id (VIN#) and the other party’s insurance
                company name.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have your phone or a camera make sure to take pictures of
                the damaged areas of both vehicles, any objects involved (such
                as guard rails, telephone poles, or buildings) and the accident
                scene. Especially skid marks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Also, take pictures of the location including street signs and
                other identifying information or landmarks if possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fill out a police accident report immediately, keep a copy for
                yourself and submit it to your insurance company.
              </li>
              <li>
                If there are witness try to get names and phone number and if
                possible a statement from them, preferably written or recorded
                on your cell phone, at the scene as to what they saw happen.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the police are involved ask them if anyone is going be cited.
              </li>
              <li>Report the accident to you insurance company immediately.</li>
              <li>
                If your vehicle needs to be towed, tell the towing company where
                you want your car taken to. Remember, the insurance company
                usually pays for the towing.
              </li>
              <li>Even though it’s hard, try to remain calm.</li>
              <li>
                After you get home go to your computer and google “What should I
                do after an accident in Massachusetts” and if you find something
                you didn’t take care of at the scene, don’t wait, take care of
                it right away.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                Air contracts in cold weather, dropping PSI ~1 PSI per 10°F. A
                chilly night can trigger TPMS.
              </li>
              <li>
                Check PSI “cold” (before driving). Inflate to the door-jamb
                placard—<em>not</em> the sidewall max.
              </li>
              <li>
                Underinflation = poor handling + faster tire wear + worse MPG.
                Overinflation = harsh ride + center wear.
