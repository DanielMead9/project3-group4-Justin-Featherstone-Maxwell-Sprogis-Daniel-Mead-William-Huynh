          “I had pulled into a parking spot that had a chunk of ice which pulled
          off the plastic undercover of the front of my car. When I hit 40 mph,
          my car sounded like a bicycle with a trading card in the spokes. After
          being told it would be a wait of at least two weeks to get it repaired
          at a Toyota collison center, I stopped at AV Repair on my way to work.
          Not only was my car put on the lift within 10 minutes, Mr. Smetanka
          had the mechanic put in some screws to hold it in place. He explained
          that except for the fact the plastic was a bit ragged from scraping
          the road, it did not need any further repair. When I asked for the
          bill, he said , "No charge. Glad to help." I haven't had anyone be
          this honest and generous in a long time. I will definitely take my car
          here if it needs any repairs. I have also recommended AV repair to all
          my friends in the area.”

          “On a Thursday evening, I called AV Repair to have them look at some
          rear bumper damage to my car. Jim was able to look at it first thing
          Friday morning. When I dropped it off, he took a look at it, explained
          what he could see, then explained to me what the potential issues
          could be once they looked underneath. About an hour later he called
          back and explained the situation: cosmetic damage only. I pushed a
          little to make sure there wasn't anything that I really needed to take
          care of. He explained which layers of the bumper had absorbed the
          impact and which hadn't even been touched, setting my mind at ease.
          <br /><br />
          I would go back to AV Repair in a heartbeat. They have a strong
          customer service focus, are patient, and they're willing to educate
          people like me.”

          “I've been in the area almost 13yrs and have never found a garage that
          I felt I could really trust.
          <br /><br />
          We found this place as we were looking for a repair shop after our car
          was involved in fender bender and needed body work back in
          Dec'12/Jan'13. Jim was very helpful and informative and he also took
          time to explain a lot of the work that was needed. He also mentioned
          they do more than ust autobody work and based on the that, we decided
          to send our cars over for maintenance and other repairs.
          <br /><br />
          Since we started going there, we have been VERY pleased with the
          service, the quick turnaround time, the reasonable prices, and also
          with Jim's candor. If we we’re looking at a big job for a car, he
          asked what our intentions were to put into perspective whether the fix
          was really needed or possibly a nice-to-have. We ended up not having
          the job done, which would have been more than $2k, but he's earned our
          trust and repeated business.”

          “I was visiting from out of town, got side-swiped, and needed to get a
          fast repair. These guys were great: trustworthy, honest, reliable, and
          friendly. They gave me a very fair price for the work, they did it
          super fast, and they did exactly what they promised. I am so glad I
          found these guys.”

          “Jim and his team are my go-to auto service shop. I’ve been taking my
          cars to him for over 25 years. They’ve done everything from body work
          to engine repair. I wouldn’t think of taking a vehicle of mine
          anywhere else.”
